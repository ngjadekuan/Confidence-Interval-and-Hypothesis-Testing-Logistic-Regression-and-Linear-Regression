# Confidence-Interval-Hypothesis-Testing-Logistic-Regression-and-Linear-Regression


For the 3D printing process to be considered a success for a printing company, we are going to require the following facts to be true:
- The mean print thickness must be 1mm
- The confidence interval for the mean must be  â‰¤ 0.1mm wide

Hypothesis and confidence interval method were used to determine whether the corresponding values are within the 99% confidence intervals
for estimates, and also whether the wideness of confidence intervals fits. Both methods were also used to test whether the two new 3D printing methods is better in comparison to the old method.
